But the same can be said of all of education. Teachers with a special education certification are specially trained to do special things with special students. Special education can sometimes be differentiated from general education by its curriculum-that is, by what is taught. Some children need intensive, systematic instruction to learn skills that typically developing children acquire without instruction. Special education also differs from general education by its use of specialized, or adapted, materials and methods. Other features that often distinguish special education teaching from instruction in general education are its precision, focus, intensity, and frequency of student progress measures. Special education can sometimes be identified (but not defined) by where it takes place. Although the majority of children with disabilities spend most of the school day in general education classrooms, others are in separate classrooms or separate residential and day schools. The differences between general and special education are important. General education is an entitlement for all students. Special education is reserved for students with disabilities who need special education and related services to perform to their optimal capacity.","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":38}},"html5data":{"xPos":-1,"yPos":-1,"width":1107,"height":726,"strokewidth":0}},"width":1106,"height":725,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6dGAiu73uE8"}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":16,"yPos":258,"tabIndex":4,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":624,"rotateYPos":213.5,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"rotation":0,"depth":4,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"html5data":{"url":"","xPos":16,"yPos":258,"width":1248,"height":426,"strokewidth":0}},"width":1248,"height":426,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"background":{"type":"vector","vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":1248,"bottom":427,"altText":"Scroll 1","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":37}}},"id":"60XPtA5OIJx"}],"startTime":-1,"elapsedTimeMode":"normal","useHandCursor":false,"resume":false,"kind":"slidelayer","isBaseLayer":true}]}');
